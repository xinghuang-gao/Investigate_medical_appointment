## Introduction
The dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazill 2016. We focused on to understand why patients did not show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
Given information and attributes about a patient, how likly a patient will show up and what the most important characteristics about patient are correlated with show-up appointment. Throughout the project, we will explore the data set to get answers and connect among the variables.

## More specific questions:
**(1)** How many patients visited the hospital with multiple times?

**(2)** If there exists a correlation between patient with the scholarship and no-show frequence?

**(3)** If there exists a correlation between patient ages and no-show frequence?

**(4)** If there exists a correlation between aging and occurrences of health issues?
